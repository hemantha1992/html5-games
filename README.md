These are two simple games that I made on HTML5 canvas with JavaScript.
One ofthem is a coin game: you are given 10 coins, placed on a 7 x 5 grid, that form a triangle. The user is supposed to invert the triangle, moving just three of them. Any attempt to make more than three moves will result in a warning, prompting the user to refresh - for a fresh start.
The second game is an interactive crossword puzzle: the user can drag the letters from an list and fill it in, in order to complete a hilarious puzzle.
